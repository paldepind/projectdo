## What

`projectdo` is a command-line program that executes project actions (such as
build, run, test, etc.) with the appropriate tool for current project in the
working directory. The appropriate tool and the current project root is
intelligently detected based on the context where `projectdo` is executed. For
instance, `projectdo test` runs `cargo test` if a `Cargo.toml` is found and
`npm test` if a `package.json` file is found.

By combining `projectdo` with shell aliases or shell abbreviations project
commands can be run in any project with less typing. As an example, with the
alias `alias b='projectdo build'` one can build any project simply by typing
<kbd>b</kbd>+<kbd>enter</kbd>.

## Install

`projectdo` can be installed through a number of package managers or by
manually downloading the shell script.

### Homebrew

`projectdo` can be installed with Homebrew on macOS and Linux.

```
brew install paldepind/tap/projectdo
```

### AUR (Arch Linux)

The [AUR package](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/projectdo) can be installed manually or using an AUR helper.

```sh
yay -S projectdo
```

### npm

`projectdo` is not related to Node.js or JavaScript, but npm works perfectly
fine for distributing shell scripts and can be a handy installation method if
you're already using npm:


```sh
npm i -g projectdo
```

### From source

Download the script and place it somewhere in your path. For instance if
`~/bin` is in your path:

```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paldepind/projectdo/main/projectdo -o ~/bin/projectdo
chmod +x ~/bin/projectdo
```

#### From repository

Clone the project repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/paldepind/projectdo; cd projectdo
```

Install it with this command:

```sh
make install

# Or to uninstall
make uninstall
```

## Shell integration

For the Fish shell use [the Fish plugin](#fish-plugin). For Bash and Zsh setup
[shell aliases](#aliases).

### Fish Plugin

`projectdo` ships with a plugin for the Fish shell. The plugin includes
auto-completion and functions for use with Fish's abbreviation feature.

The Fish plugin can be installed manually or with
[Fisher](https://github.com/jorgebucaran/fisher):

```
fisher install paldepind/projectdo
```

The plugin exposes four shell functions that should be configured with
abbreviations as desired. For instance:

```
abbr -a b --function projectdo_build
abbr -a r --function projectdo_run
abbr -a t --function projectdo_test
abbr -a p --function projectdo_tool
```

With the above `t` will expand to `cargo test`, `p` will expand to `cargo`,
etc. depending on the project.

_Note that you need to have the script in your path in order for the Fish plugin to work!_

### Aliases

`projectdo` can be configured with shell aliases in any shell. For instance:

```sh
alias t='projectdo test'
alias r='projectdo run'
alias b='projectdo build'
alias p='projectdo tool'
```

## Usage

**Note**: When executed with the `-d` flag `projectdo` performs a dry run and
only prints information about what it would do without actually doing anything.
It is a good idea to do a dry run when using `projectdo` in a project for the
first time to verify that it does the right thing.

```
Usage: projectdo [options] [action] [tool-arguments]
Options:
  -h, --help             Display this help.
  -n, -d, --dry-run      Do not execute any commands with side-effects.
  -q, --quiet            Do not print commands as they are about to be executed.
  -v, --version          Display the version of the program.

Actions:
  build, run, test       Build, run, or test the current project.
  tool                   Invoke the guessed tool for the current project.

Tool arguments:
  Any arguments following [action] are passed along to the invoked tool.
```
